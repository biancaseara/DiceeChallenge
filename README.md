## ‚ú® About The Project

This project was an exercise focused on **JavaScript and DOM manipulation**, based on a challenge from the **"The Complete Web Development Bootcamp"** course by [App Brewery](https://www.appbrewery.co/).

The challenge was to take a static web page, with the HTML and CSS already provided, and bring it to life. **My contribution was to write the `script.js` file from scratch**, implementing the game's entire functionality, which includes:

* Generating random numbers for both dice.
* Dynamically changing the dice images to match the results.
* Declaring a winner based on the outcome.

All of the page's interactivity was built by me through the manipulation of the existing HTML elements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

My main focus was on:

* **JavaScript:** For all the game logic and DOM manipulation.

The project also uses:
* **HTML5:** For the page structure (provided).
* **CSS3:** For the visual styling (provided).

## üöÄ Getting Started

This is a static project and requires no complex installation.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/biancaseara/DiceeChallenge.git](https://github.com/biancaseara/DiceeChallenge.git)
    ```
2.  **Open the `index.html` file:**
    Navigate to the project folder and open the `index.html` file directly in your browser.

That's it! Every time you refresh the page (`F5`), the script will run and a new game will be played.

## üß† What I Learned

By developing the script for this project, I practiced fundamental JavaScript concepts, such as:

* **DOM Manipulation:** Using `document.querySelector()` to select HTML elements.
* **Attribute Modification:** Using `setAttribute()` to change the dice image (`src`).
* **Content Modification:** Using `textContent` to change the text of the `<h1>` title.
* **Random Number Generation:** Applying `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()` to simulate a dice roll.
* **Conditional Logic:** Using `if`, `else if`, and `else` to determine the winner.
